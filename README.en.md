`karmind-skill` is a portable Agent Skill for coding agents. It maintains a long-lived LLM Wiki: a source-grounded, linked, logged, and continuously updated Markdown knowledge base.

It follows Andrej Karpathy's [LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) idea: instead of asking an LLM to rediscover scattered chunks from scratch every time, let an agent continuously compile sources into a structured wiki. Every new source, question, and contradiction should make the wiki more useful.

## Why This Exists

Typical RAG splits material into chunks and retrieves them at question time. An LLM Wiki is different: it separates raw evidence, maintained wiki pages, and local operating schema so an agent can maintain knowledge the way it maintains a codebase.

| Layer | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw sources | `raw/` | Immutable evidence: papers, clipped web pages, interviews, images, CSVs, PDF-derived text |
| Wiki | `wiki/` | Maintained knowledge: source notes, entity pages, concept pages, questions, synthesis |
| Schema | `AGENTS.md` | Local operating manual for directories, citations, cache, logs, and maintenance rules |

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Wiki initialization | Creates `raw/`, `wiki/`, `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`, `wiki/cache/`, and `wiki/reports/` |
| Existing-note import | Scans existing documents and moves or copies them into `raw/imported/` after user approval |
| Source ingest | Extracts claims, entities, concepts, timelines, contradictions, and open questions |
| Cache-aware processing | Tracks `pending`, `drafted`, `processed`, `failed`, and `skipped` in `wiki/cache/ingest-cache.json` |
| Asset mirroring | Copies local raw images/attachments into `wiki/assets/` and downloads remote images |
| External model batch ingest | Uses any OpenAI-compatible model to draft reviewable source notes in batches |
| Wiki doctor | Reports broken links, orphan pages, unprocessed sources, cache status, and maintenance actions |
| Doctor finding repair | Fixes report findings only after explicit user request, with risk-based approval rules |
| Obsidian-friendly | Supports wikilinks, assets, graph/backlinks, Dataview, Canvas, and Marp-style outputs |

## Installation Guidance

Enable this skill only inside projects that actually contain an LLM Wiki. Global installation is not recommended by default because the skill scans documents and maintains `raw/` and `wiki/`, which can be noisy in ordinary code projects.

Once installed in a wiki directory, normal questions default to wiki-grounded answers. You can ask directly without saying "use the wiki" every time.

### Claude Code Plugin

Claude Code users should prefer plugin marketplace installation:

```text
/plugin marketplace add karmind-skills Lhy723/karmind-skill
/plugin install karmind-skill@karmind-skills
```

### Skills CLI

Run from the target wiki project:

```bash
npx -y skills add Lhy723/karmind-skill --skill karmind-skill --agent '*' -y
```

### Recommended: One-Command Install

Run the one-command installer from the target wiki project. It asks for the target agent and copies only the lightweight skill files.

macOS / Linux:

```bash
cd your-project
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lhy723/karmind-skill/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd your-project
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lhy723/karmind-skill/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Manual Install

If you do not use the Claude Code plugin or the `skills` CLI, manually place the lightweight skill files in the target agent directory. Use sparse checkout or copy from a local checkout. Do not copy the whole repository. Install `SKILL.md`, `references/`, and `scripts/`; Codex also gets `agents/`, and Trae also gets `.trae/rules/project_rules.md`.

See the [installation guide](docs/en/INSTALL.md) for exact directories and commands.

### Local Development Install

Preview a local checkout:

```bash
npx -y skills add . --list
```

Install the local checkout:

```bash
npx -y skills add . --skill karmind-skill --agent '*' -y
```

Claude Code local plugin install:

```text
/plugin marketplace add karmind-local <local-repo-path>
/plugin install karmind-skill@karmind-local
```

## Quick Start

Open your agent in the target directory and say:

```text
Use karmind-skill to initialize an LLM Wiki in the current directory.
```

During initialization, the agent should generate templates in the current conversation language. Chinese and English can use the bundled script directly; for other languages, the agent should temporarily localize the initialization script by rewriting only human-readable headings and prose, then run that temporary copy.

After adding sources, continue with:

```text
Use karmind-skill to compile new sources.
```

If there are many raw files:

```text
Use karmind-skill to inspect pending material.
```

Manual fallback command:

macOS / Linux:

```bash
python /tmp/karmind-skill/scripts/init_wiki.py . --scan-existing --language en
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python "$env:TEMP\karmind-skill\scripts\init_wiki.py" . --scan-existing --language en
```

```

## Common Workflows

Prefer natural-language prompts. The bundled scripts are deterministic tools for the agent or user to call when needed.

| Workflow | Recommended prompt |
| --- | --- |
| Initialize wiki | `Use karmind-skill to initialize an LLM Wiki in the current directory. First scan for existing notes or documents, list candidates, and ask whether to move, copy, or skip them.` |
| Ingest sources | `Use karmind-skill to ingest new sources.` |
| Process pending sources | `Use karmind-skill to inspect pending material, suggest what to process next by importance, and wait for my confirmation.` |
| Model batch ingest | `Use karmind-skill to configure external-model batch processing. Run a dry run first, tell me which files, model, and reports will be used, then wait for confirmation.` |
| Force re-extract | `Use karmind-skill to force re-extraction. Explain which cache entries will be reset before doing it.` |
| Default Q&A | `What evidence supports this claim?` |
| Comparative analysis | `Compare A and B in a table.` |
| Trace sources | `Which sources support this conclusion?` |
| Archive an answer | `File the previous answer.` |
| Wiki doctor | `Use karmind-skill to run a health check.` |
| Fix doctor findings | `Use karmind-skill to fix issues from the latest health report. Do not delete pages; ask me before merging, splitting, or renaming pages.` |

When multiple pending raw files exist, `ingest new sources` asks for the processing mode first: external-model batch processing, manual agent loop, next file only, or defer.

External-model batch processing writes to `wiki/sources/_drafts/` by default and marks cache entries `drafted`; reviewed notes are promoted to `wiki/sources/` and then marked `processed`.

If a raw article references images or attachments, the agent mirrors them into `wiki/assets/`; remote image URLs are downloaded as local copies, and source notes should cite the local copies.

Wiki doctor reports are written to:

```text
wiki/reports/doctor-report.md
```

Model batch reports are written to:

```text
wiki/reports/batch/
```

Configure model API keys through environment variables or a local `.env.local`; do not write keys into the wiki. See [模型 API Key 配置](docs/zh/MODEL_KEYS.md) / [Model API Key Configuration](docs/en/MODEL_KEYS.md).

Doctor repair policy:

- Low-risk findings can be fixed directly: obvious broken links, missing index entries, orphan links, missing citations, and question-page stubs.
- Medium-risk findings need a short plan first: duplicated pages, large-page splits, and page renames.
- High-risk findings require confirmation: deleting pages, overwriting source notes, resetting cache, batch re-ingest, or schema changes.
- If a repair creates factual concept/entity pages, search local wiki/raw first; when evidence is insufficient, use available web search/browsing to verify authoritative sources and cite them instead of writing from memory.
- After repairs, update `wiki/index.md`, append `wiki/log.md`, and rerun the doctor.

## Design Principles

- Raw sources are immutable; wiki pages are maintained.
- Important claims should trace back to source notes or raw sources.
- `index.md` is for navigation, and `log.md` is for chronological history.
- `ingest-cache.json` tracks processing state. External-model output starts as `drafted`; reviewed notes become `processed`.
- Contradictions and uncertainty are part of the knowledge base and should be explicit.
- Start with Markdown, `rg`, and index files. Add vector databases, MCP search, or other tools only when scale demands them.
- Answers do not have to be prose; they can become tables, timelines, diagrams, Marp slide markdown, or Obsidian Canvas notes.
